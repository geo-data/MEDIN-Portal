<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The MEDIN portal is a metadata discovery service providing users
with a single point of access to a well-balanced, authoritative marine
metadata catalogue.</p>
<p class="notice">Please note this is a ‘work in progress’ and there
will be an increase in number of records and coverage over the next 12
to 18 months.</p>
<p>Metadata records are available for UK marine data sets across all
subject areas and disciplines. This includes UK organisations
undertaking data collection in non-UK waters. There are other portals
which contain data for more specific data themes or from a European
rather than a UK perspective.</p>
<p>The main sources of metadata are the network of MEDIN accredited
Data Archiving Centres (DACs). These currently include geographic and
geological data from the British Geological Survey (BGS),
oceanographic data from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC),
bathymetry data from the UK Hydrographic Office (UKHO) and habitat and
species data from the Data Archive on Seabed Species and Habitats
(DASSH).</p>
<p>It is expected that the following major datasets and catalogues
will be incorporated into the portal in the near future: the UK
Directory for Marine Observing Systems (UKDMOS), MERMAN, and marine
metadata from the National Biodiversity Network (NBN).</p>
<p>The portal search facility allows for the copy and paste of the URL
to ‘keep a search’ and return to the generated results page or send
the link to others. There is also open search functionality on the
portal.</p>
<p>If your dataset(s) are not here and you would like them included
please email <a
href="mailto:enquiries@oceannet.org">enquiries@oceannet.org</a></p>

      <h3>Advanced search</h3>
      <p>Words typed in 'as is' will result in a full text search that
      requires all words to be present in the results.</p>      
      <blockquote>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Example</strong>: type the following to find all
          documents containing the words <kbd>acoustic</kbd>

        </div>
        <div class="example"><kbd>acoustic currents sediment</kbd></div>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Words can be excluded from result matches using the
      <strong>minus sign</strong> (<strong>-</strong>).</p>
      <blockquote>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Example</strong>: type the following to find all

        </div>
        <div class="example"><kbd><strong>-</strong>acoustic currents <strong>-</strong>sediment</kbd></div>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Instead of finding all matching terms, alternative matches can
      be specified using the word <strong>OR</strong>
      (in capitals)</p>
      <blockquote>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Example</strong>: type the following to find
          all documents that contain <kbd>sediment</kbd> and

        </div>
        <div class="example"><kbd>acoustic <strong>OR</strong> currents sediment</kbd></div>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>As well as running full text searches, more specific search
      targets can be specified by prefixing search terms with a target
      identifier.  Available target identifiers and how they relate to
      search fields are as follows:</p>

      <p>Create a <strong>new box</strong> by holding down the

      the left mouse button. Releasing the button creates the box and

      <p>An <strong>existing box</strong> can be resized by clicking

      <p>As well as using the visible navigation icons on the map you

      a mouse-wheel you can use this to <strong>zoom in or
